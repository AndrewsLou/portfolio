				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xQoS3hR.jpg">
				<p>
				I am a 19 year old with an ambition to make a mark on society and provide for my family and friends in whatever way I can. 
				I have been living at home looking after my siblings for the last year but thinks it is definitely time to get a full time job 
				and start learning what I need to in order to move out and move on with my life. I am a keen helper and have been brought up 
				to respect and learn where I can and help as much as possible.

				<h3>Interest and Hobbies</h3>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b8hC1bl.jpg">
				<p>
				I have several different interests but coming from a family of engineers means that I have a lot of interests in cars and 
				motorbikes (with a slight edge towards motorbikes). However I spend most of my time playing competitive games and building 
				computers, when the budget allows it at least!

				I am also a keen outdoor enthusiast thanks to my 12 years in scouting. I like to go on hikes with friends and would like 
				to try airsoft once I can afford the gear in order to do so. I have spent most of my childhood outdoors thanks to my country based location.

				Within the last few years I have moved tentatively towards the software side of computing during my computing A level and 
				short amount of time spent at my university degree in games programming; which sadly came to an early end due to trouble at home. 
				Regardless of this small stunt in progress I am very keen to learn more about coding and especially web development.

				<h3>Previous Work and Motivation</h3>
				<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xQoS3hR.jpg">
				<p>
				Most of my previous work has been relatively physical from fixing cars to serving customers in a shop. However I pride myself 
				in having a good work ethic and finishing my work to a high standard. Although my previous work has been very physical I still 
				consider myself quite a logical but creative person with a keen eye for what is usable but attractive to an end user.

				When it comes to coding most of the work I have done is within my education with lots of it being during my A level computing 
				and the rest during my time at university where I learnt the basics of C, C++, Visual basic and C#. I have also started an online 
				coding course for HTML and CSS in order to get a headstart and learnt the basics for web development.

				<h3>Web Development</h3>

				<p>
				As far as web development goes my experience goes as far as online starter courses and extensive use of Sites like Wordpress 
				during my A levels. I have also helped create a Wordpress site for a choir in Edinburgh. All of these I have linked below.

				I am also very familiar with the adobe suite as I have used them for several of my subjects and in my personal time as well. 
				I have added some examples of work below as well.
